# PY-to-EXE
Simple and easy way to convert Python files to standalone EXEs

Thank you for downloading the Python to EXE Convertor

Important Notes:
- Your ico/py file cannot have spaces
- If you are running into issues, email me at crazyCoder1123@outlook.com
- untick the console checkbox if you have a GUI program (Kivy, PyQt5, Tkinter, Pygame, etc.)
